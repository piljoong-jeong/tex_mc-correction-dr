\section{Methods}

\paragraph{Assumptions}
Our goal is to minimize TSDF mesh noise fused from 
a single, Lambertian-dominant indoor RGB-D frame. 
Given the scenario, we assume that we know intrinsic, extrinsic parameters of camera used to capture the frame. 
Specifically, we pre-computed input TSDF mesh $\mathcal{M}$ from 
pair of GT color image $\mathcal{C}$ and depth image $\mathcal{D}$ with known intrinsic $K$, such that $\mathcal{M}=TSDF(K^-1(\mathcal{C}\oplus\mathcal{D}))$.
Here, $\oplus$  denotes image registration operator. 
We used popular SLAM framework [8] to generate $\mathcal{M}$ with voxel size as 2cm. 
Since $\mathcal{D}$ is noisy measurement of real scene geometry, 
$\mathcal{M}$, and its rendering $C$ have slightly different appearance compare with $\mathcal{C}$. 
We additionally constraint that there are no strong texture changes 
under geometrically close, flat surfaces (e.g., chessboard pattern on flat wall). 
This assumption is used to ensure that strong radiance change is 
only made from interaction between light and hit-point geometry within C. 
We will elaborate this assumption later.
