\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we proposed a method that optimizes input TSDF mesh generated from single RGB-D pair, by exploiting noise-free geometric clues hidden in color image. 
Our method differs from most of previous methods as they required to optimize shape from multiple takes of target scene, which is hard to directly apply to SLAM dataset. 
We show that our method outperforms previous differentiable rendering setup. 
Future work on improving robustness in terms of optimizing edgy geometries, preventing topological correctness of input mesh would be beneficial to solve problem that is defined as ill-posed in SLAM.
